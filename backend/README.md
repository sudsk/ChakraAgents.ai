# API Integration Changes

## Overview

The backend API has been consolidated to provide a more consistent interface for the frontend. The changes focus on creating a unified agentic API router that aligns with the frontend's expected API endpoints.

## Key Changes

1. **Consolidated Agentic API Routes**
   - Created a single `agentic.py` router with the prefix `/api/agentic`
   - Implemented all endpoints required by the frontend

2. **Updated Main Application**
   - Updated `main.py` to include the consolidated agentic router
   - Removed redundant routers to eliminate duplication and inconsistency

3. **Aligned API Paths**
   - Ensured all routes match what the frontend expects
   - Maintained the same path structure as referenced in the frontend's `api.js`

## API Endpoints

The following endpoints are now available through the consolidated API:

### Workflows

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET    | `/api/agentic/workflows` | Get all agentic workflows |
| POST   | `/api/agentic/workflows` | Create a new agentic workflow |
| GET    | `/api/agentic/workflows/{id}` | Get a specific workflow |
| PUT    | `/api/agentic/workflows/{id}` | Update a workflow |
| DELETE | `/api/agentic/workflows/{id}` | Delete a workflow |
| POST   | `/api/agentic/workflows/{id}/run` | Run a workflow |

### Executions

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET    | `/api/agentic/executions` | Get all workflow executions |
| GET    | `/api/agentic/executions/{id}` | Get a specific execution |
| POST   | `/api/agentic/executions/{id}/cancel` | Cancel an execution |
| GET    | `/api/agentic/executions/{id}/decisions` | Get decisions for an execution |

### Tools

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET    | `/api/agentic/tools` | Get all available tools |
| POST   | `/api/agentic/tools/test` | Test a tool with provided parameters |

### Validation

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST   | `/api/agentic/validate` | Validate a workflow configuration |

## Status of Original Files

The following files have been effectively replaced by the consolidated API:

1. `agentic_api.py` - Replaced by new `agentic.py`
2. `agentic_workflows.py` - Replaced by new `agentic.py`
3. `routes/agentic_workflow_routes.py` - Replaced by new `agentic.py`

The following files remain but are not directly used by the frontend:

1. `executions.py` - Contains general workflow execution logic (not agentic-specific)
2. `templates.py` - Contains template management functionality still used by the backend

## Integration with Frontend

The new API endpoints now align perfectly with the frontend's expectations in `frontend/src/services/api.js`. The frontend should be able to interact with the backend without any changes.

## Testing

Integration tests have been added to verify the API routes and ensure they respond correctly to requests.
